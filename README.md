# elm-reason-react-ts-js
An example of a setup to use co-existing [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io), [React](https://reactjs.org), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/JavaScript)

# Why
- I like them with each different reasons
- I never was completely satisfied with using just one of them
- It would be really nice to have an template/example to have the simplest setup possible to use all of them smoothly.

# Front-end 
> **WIP**
> set up with a bundler

# Back-end
> **WIP**
> set up with nodejs
