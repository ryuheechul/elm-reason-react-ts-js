# elm-reason-react-ts-js
An example of a setup to use co-existing elm, reason, react, typescript and javascript

# Why
- I like them with each different reasons
- I never was satisfied with using just one of them
- It would be really nice to have an template/example to have the simplest setup possible to use all of them smoothly.

# Front-end
> set up with a bundler

# Back-end
> set up with nodejs
